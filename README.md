# NTRU public key cryptosystem

## Overview

NTRUEncrypt is a lattice-based public key cryptosystem known for its efficiency and post-quantum security. This implementation serves as a simplified example and is not intended for production use.
This project is a simple implementation of the NTRUEncrypt algorithm, focusing on educational purposes. The code implements a basic version of NTRUEncrypt and is not intended for production use.
